# AnimePlay

### Built with

- React
- Bootstrap
- React-Router
- Axios
- SwiperJs

I have used [JIKAN API](https://jikan.moe/) for this website.They provide a lot of options,filters to get a desired set of anime.This website is also mobile responsive, and also has custom 
WatchList and SignIn features. I have used localStorage to store user details and watchlist content intentionally. I can use firebase, but just want to flex my skills 
with Browser API.This website is hosted on vercel but you can also download to your local system.

## Installation
